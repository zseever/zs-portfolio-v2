            I am analytically-minded, and am always looking for the next process that I can improve. I find great enjoyment out of solving 
            problems and overcoming these challenges gives me a sense of pride and achievement. In my previous career as a customer and market 
            insights analyst, I was constantly challenged to think outside the box and find new and improved ways to measure customer value and 
            purchasing habits. As a Software Engineer, I want to continue to create, improve, and solve difficult problems.
