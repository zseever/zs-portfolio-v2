                Since graduating with a degree in Business Administration in 2016, I initially found my first job in analytics. In my analytics roles over the years,
                I found myself constantly trying to come up with ways to make my job more efficient. From things such as automating recurring Excel reports
                through Visual Basic, saving significant report run times in MicroStrategy by taking new approaches, or using Python to assist with running SQL queries
                and formatting the data into Excel or PowerPoint, these were the kinds of tasks that I truly enjoyed.

            <div>
                As I continued down this field, I started to realize that what I actually enjoyed seemed to align more with Software Engineering. With that realization, I
                decided to pursue this career change by enrolling in a Software Engineering Bootcamp at General Assembly and then continuing to work on my own projects, as well as
                data structures and algorithm knowledge. With my previous analytics background and strong foundation with SQL and some experience in VBA and Python, combined
                with my newer education, I believe I have what it takes to be a successful Software Engineer.
